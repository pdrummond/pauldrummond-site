1. P3 - No matter who you are, where you're from, what your background is, what you've done and haven't done, what status or wealth you do or don't have, Martian or not, you can find total peace, unconditional love, complete fulfillment, and an abundance of joy in your life.
2. P4 - In actuality, we only want these external results like money and significance because we want to experience certain feelings inside such as love, joy, peace, and fulfillment. The feeling is really what we want in our lives, not the physical things, but the trap is that we believe the physical things will give us those feelings. The secret lies within the feeling.

   To find everything you're looking for in life, you must look inside yourself and discover the wisdom that already exists within you. All the answers lie deep within your soul.

   Truth cannot be intellectualized ; it can only be experienced.

   If you want to find truth, look beyond the words, and look for a feeling.

   In this book, I will not say anything that you don't already know deep inside your soul.

   Don’t try to use your intellect to figure it out — you won’t. As soon as you intellectualize it, you've missed it.

   That's what we're all ultimately seeking, isn't it ?

   What I will unveil to you in this book will seem simple. It will seem almost too simple, and your brain ( ego ) will try to fight it or attempt to make it more complex. It will think that it can’t be this simple. When that time comes, I want you to remember that the truth is always simple.
   Chapter 1: The Journey to Finding the Root Cause of Suffering

   " People have a hard time letting go of their suffering. Out of a fear of the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar. ”

   There is a way in which, no matter what happens in your life, you do not have to suffer emotionally and psychologically.

   Buddhists say that anytime we experience a negative event in our lives, two arrows fly our way. Being physically struck by an arrow is painful. Being struck by a second emotional arrow is even more painful ( suffering ).
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 10 · Location 135
   Although some of these things did help me improve incrementally, it didn’t stop my suffering. I still always felt extremely anxious, fearful, unfulfilled, irritated, angry, frustrated, and heavy every day. Even after doing all of that, I still didn't discover the answer and, if I'm being honest, I was even more lost than before I started on this quest.
   Chapter 2: The Root Cause of All Suffering

   “ One who looks around him is intelligent, one who looks within him is wise. ” ― Matshona Dhliwayo
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 12 · Location 162
   Reality is that the event happened, with no meaning, thinking, or interpretation of it.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 15 · Location 189
   The root cause of our suffering is our own thinking.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 15 · Location 192
   If we know that we can only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we can change our feelings by changing our thinking.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 16 · Location 195
   In short, the moment we stop thinking is when our happiness begins.

   “ I think and think and think, I've thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it. ” — Jonathan Safran Foer
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 20 · Location 238
   Our minds do an incredible job to keep us alive, but it does not help us thrive. It is concerned solely with our safety and survival, but not our fulfillment or joy.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 21 · Location 244
   Our mind’s duty is to keep us alive. Our consciousness’s duty is to help us feel fulfilled. Your soul is the reason why you’re even on this journey in the first place — to find peace, love, and joy for yourself.
   Chapter 4: Thoughts vs. Thinking
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 22 · Location 256
   It’s important to know that thoughts are a noun and aren’t something that we do, but something we have.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 22 · Location 258
   Thinking, on the other hand, is the act of thinking about our thoughts.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 22 · Location 260
   You don’t have to engage with each thought in your mind, but when you do, that is thinking.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 23 · Location 261
   Thinking is the root cause of all our psychological suffering.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 25 · Location 289
   It is not necessary to think about our thoughts or to judge them. It does us no good to do so.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 26 · Location 293
   Thoughts create. Thinking destroys.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 26 · Location 293
   The reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we begin to think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting beliefs, judgements, criticisms, programming, and
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 26 · Location 299
   You’ll know you are having thoughts from the divine when you feel positive emotions, feel lighter, and alive.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 27 · Location 300
   you’ll immediately feel heavy, restricted, limited, along with a whole onslaught of negative emotions. This is how you’ll know if you’re thinking.
   Chapter 5: If We Can Only Feel What We're Thinking, Don't We Need to Think Positively to Feel That Way?
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 29 · Location 334
   Some of the negative emotions can be helpful, such as feeling fearful when deciding to walk down a dark alley alone with no one else in sight.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 31 · Location 347
   What's crazy is that most people didn't have any thoughts going through their mind when they felt the happiest and the most amount of love in their lives.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 31 · Location 351
   you do not have to have thoughts or think to feel positive emotions.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 31 · Location 354
   Our natural state of being IS joy, love, ecstasy, freedom, and gratitude.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 32 · Location 358
   Are babies naturally stressed, anxious, fearful, and self - conscious ? Or are they naturally in a state of bliss, happiness, and love ?
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 32 · Location 359
   Our natural state of being is joy, love, and peace.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 32 · Location 363
   the less thinking we have going on, the stronger the positive emotion we feel in the present.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 33 · Location 371
   It is not the content of our thinking that causes us stress, but that we are thinking, period.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 33 · Location 372
   When you're experiencing a lot of frustration, stress, anxiety, or any negative emotions, just know that it is because you're thinking, and the intensity of those emotions is directly correlated to how much thinking is going on.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 33 · Location 374
   Therefore, it's not WHAT we're thinking about that is causing us suffering, but THAT we are thinking.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 34 · Location 378
   It is not about the content of our thinking, but that we're thinking, which is the root cause of our suffering.
   Chapter 6: How the Human Experience is Created - The Three Principles
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 36 · Location 392
   The Intelligence that knows how to do all of this and is in all things is called the Universal Mind. Many people call this God, Infinite Intelligence, the Quantum Field, Source, and other names.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 36 · Location 395
   When we are connected to Universal Mind, we feel whole, fulfilled, filled with love, joy, peace, and inspiration. It is only when we begin thinking ( believing the illusion or ego ) that we block this flow of Universal Mind and begin to feel separated, frustrated, lonely, angry, resentful, sad, depressed, and fearful.

   Looking straight into the samurai’s eyes, the Zen master tenderly declared, “ That’s hell. ”

   The samurai’s eyes filled with tears. Setting his sword aside, he put his palms together and obsequiously bowed in gratitude for this insight.

   The Zen master gently acknowledged with a delicate smile, “ And that’s heaven. ”
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 39 · Location 422
   It's not possible to just entirely stop thinking, but what we can do is reduce the time we spend thinking so that it gets smaller and smaller each day that passes.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 40 · Location 427
   The most interesting and almost paradoxical thing about stopping our thinking is that we don't have to do anything to minimize it other than to be aware of it.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 40 · Location 435
   This is how our minds also work. If we let our thinking sit without disturbing it by trying to " filter " or " boil " it, the thinking will settle down on its own and our minds will become free from thinking. The natural state of water is clear, and the natural state of our minds is also clear, if we do not disturb it.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 42 · Location 447
   There is no way that we can remain in a state of non - thinking every second of every day and if we try to make that a goal, we will cause ourselves to suffer by forcing ourselves back into thinking again.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 42 · Location 454
   What can give us true peace is knowing that we always have this state of pure peace, love, and fulfillment underneath any thinking that we may ever have at any given moment
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 43 · Location 459
   We are ever really one moment away from remembering that we always have that infinite well of clarity, love, joy, peace, and fulfillment.
   Chapter 8: How Can We Possibly Thrive In the World Without Thinking?
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 44 · Location 467
   “ Anxiety is thought without control. Flow is control without thought. ” — James Clear
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 45 · Location 478
   It may seem crazy, but we do our best work when we aren't thinking, and you just proved it with your own experience.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 46 · Location 492
   Without thinking, we are free from limitations of the ego and are able to create the most incredible things in the world.
   Chapter 9: If We Stop Thinking, What Do We Do About Our Goals, Dreams & Ambitions?
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 49 · Location 518
   Like everything in this world, there is nothing inherently good or bad, only our thinking makes it so.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 49 · Location 520
   There are two sources of goals : goals created out of inspiration and goals created out of desperation.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 50 · Location 528
   When we dig a little deeper into these types of goals we set, they are all typically “ means goals ” and not “ end goals ”. In other words, the goals we set in this state of desperation are all a means to an end. There's always a reason we want to accomplish the goal and it's always for something else.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 51 · Location 540
   When we create goals out of inspiration versus desperation, it is a completely different story. In this state, we are creating because we feel deeply moved, inspired, and expansive. It feels like a calling rather than an obligation.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 51 · Location 543
   This is why painters paint, why dancers dance, why writers write and why singers sing, even if they never get paid or make a living from it. We feel pulled by a force to create something. We gravitate towards it. We feel compelled to do it. When we feel like this, we are creating from a place of abundance instead of lack.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 51 · Location 546
   Most surprising of all is that in this state, we are creating not for any reason at all, other than because we simply want to.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 51 · Location 548
   This creating comes from a place of wholeness and abundance. It's an overflowing of love and joy for life.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 52 · Location 552
   This feeling of deep inspiration is incredibly difficult to describe because it does not come from this world. It really doesn't come from us, but through us from something greater than us. I like to call this feeling divine inspiration because the ideas and vision we have of what we want to create seem to be far bigger than we could have possibly imagined or come up with ourselves.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 52 · Location 559
   It really is one of the greatest feelings we can experience, and it is truly a gift that we can experience the divine as humans ( and it's because we're from the same source ).
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 53 · Location 567
   As soon as we begin to think about the thought of us wanting to create, it completely shuts off the source of that inspiration and we go back to living life as usual. When we cut off that source, we also cut off the feelings of abundance, exuberance, ecstasy, joy, pure unconditional love, and go back to the feelings of doubt, anxiety, frustration, sadness, and feel confined, stuck, and frustrated with our lives.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 54 · Location 571
   When we stop thinking, we don't stop having goals and dreams, we actually fall back into our true nature and begin to create goals and dreams out of inspiration versus desperation. We begin to allow thoughts from the Universe to come into our mind that lead us to divine inspiration to create something that has never been created before in the world.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 54 · Location 576
   Goals and dreams that come in the form of thought are created out of inspiration. Goals and dreams that come from thinking are created out of desperation.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 55 · Location 581
   Goals and dreams created out of desperation will feel very heavy, draining, confining, and empty.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 55 · Location 582
   With these types of goals, it seems like if we do not accomplish it, that there will be dire consequences, hence the high pressure and stakes ( I'm sure you can see now how this can create the feeling of desperation ).
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 56 · Location 592
   There is no right or wrong goal, only goals created from inspiration or desperation.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 56 · Location 594
   On the other hand, goals and dreams created out of inspiration ( which comes from thought ) feel very light, energizing, uplifting, and expansive. We tend to feel excited, joyful, and most importantly, inspired. We don't feel like we HAVE to create it, but that we WANT to. Instead of feeling like you NEED to do this, you feel inspired to.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 56 · Location 597
   There is no scarcity or urgency because we don't feel like we're creating from a place of lack, but instead from a place of abundance and we just want to share it with the world. Since it's coming from inspiration, we are not doing it to get something out of it so that we can do something else.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 58 · Location 617
   " If I had infinite money, already traveled the world, had no fear, and didn't receive any recognition for what I do, what would I do or what would I create ? "

   Chapter 10: Unconditional Love & Creation
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 60 · Location 628
   “ The greatest power that mankind could ever achieve is the power of unconditional love. This is when people love with no limitations, conditions or boundaries. ” — Tony Green
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 62 · Location 646
   In that moment, I had the awe - inspiring insight that Makenna couldn't list reasons of why she loved me because her love for me was unconditional. There were no reasons for why she loved me because if she had reasons, it would mean she only loved me if I were exuding those traits or doing those things she had in her mind.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 63 · Location 664
   They are only creating this because they want something else out of it. When we create something for something else, typically we do not enjoy the process of creating, because it is always just a means to an end, never an end in itself.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 64 · Location 668
   What we're ultimately looking for are feelings. We want more money to get a sense of security and peace. We want to spend time with our family because it makes us feel so much love and joy. We want to do what we love because it gives us a sense of fulfillment inside.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 64 · Location 675
   Unconditional creation is creating something without it being for another purpose, but purely to create it because we just want to create it. It's not for money, fame, love, or anything else. We create it simply because we want to create it. This is creation from abundance.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 65 · Location 679
   We can only pursue unconditional creation if we are in a state of non - thinking. Our brains will make us think that it is pointless to do something just simply because we want to, but that is the secret.
   Chapter 11: What Do You Do Next after Experiencing Peace, Joy, Love & Fulfillment In the Present?
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 66 · Location 692
   Many of my clients, including myself, began to wonder if they lost their edge and drive to do anything in the world. Don't worry, this is all normal and part of the process of awakening.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 67 · Location 695
   The reason why we feel worried, anxiety, and doubt after we’ve experienced peace is because we have just let go of everything we thought we knew in the world. What actually happened was the death of the personal ego. A natural consequence is that once the personal ego is threatened, it will do everything in its power to regain control over your life again.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 67 · Location 701
   The point is to not try to prevent your thinking from ever entering your mind, but to shorten the time that it takes for you to remember that it is just your thinking that’s causing the negative emotions.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 68 · Location 709
   When we stop thinking, this energy we used to use to think is now “ freed up ”, but it hasn’t been directed anywhere yet and what happens is we return to our old patterns of putting that energy back into thinking because that is how we were conditioned.
   Chapter 12: Nothing Is Either Good or Bad
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 71 · Location 738
   Instead of looking for right or wrong, good or bad in the world, look for truth.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 71 · Location 742
   True truth is not subjective. If it is " true " for one person, but not for another, then it is not universal truth.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 72 · Location 750
   Negative emotions are an indication of misunderstanding.
   Chapter 13: How Do You Know What to Do without Thinking?
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 74 · Location 766
   Most of the time, we already know deep down what to do in any specific situation. This is often referred to as your gut feeling, intuition, or inner wisdom. What we do is try to confirm our intuition with the external world and this is where most of the negative emotions begin to surface, wreaking havoc on our mental state because of everyone’s opinions.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 75 · Location 783
   Those who have the faith and courage to do this, will discover the true joy, peace, and love they have been looking for while enjoying the miracle of life.

   Chapter 14: How to Follow Your Intuition
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 78 · Location 812
   The only time we can really be in a state of non - thinking is in the present moment. We can only see reality in the present moment and when we are actively thinking, it means we are either in the past or future ( which don’t exist ).
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 81 · Location 846
   This is how we can choose to be happy — by choosing to let go of our thinking.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 82 · Location 852
   This is why people believe that we have to work hard and suffer for what we want in life. That is simply not true. It is only true if we think we have to figure out the “ how ” to get what we want in life. Our job is to come up with what we want, not how to get it.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 82 · Location 858
   Our part is to hold in our minds what we want and get into a state of non - thinking. This enables us to access our Infinite Intelligence ( God ) so that the answers are revealed to us exactly when we need it.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 83 · Location 867
   Have you ever had a gut feeling to do something, but you have no logical reasoning as to why, but you did it anyway and amazing things happened afterward ? That is your intuition.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 83 · Location 868
   Our intuition does come to us in the form of thoughts, but remember that there’s a stark difference between thoughts and thinking, as we discussed in a previous chapter.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 83 · Location 872
   Your intuition will almost never seem logical or rational, but that’s exactly what we want because we don’t want it to be predictable.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 84 · Location 877
   It will tell you to step into and live in your divine gift and put yourself out there to share the truth of what you know. It will softly beckon you to pursue what you truly want in life versus following what everyone else says that you should want.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 84 · Location 880
   So why don’t more people listen to their intuition if it always knows what to do and creates abundance whenever it is followed ? Fear.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 84 · Location 881
   Listening to our intuition can be scary or extremely daunting. This is because our intuition lives in the space of the unknown.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 85 · Location 886
   The only way you can enter this space of miracles is through non - thinking.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 85 · Location 891
   In summary, your intuition always knows what you need to do in the present moment, but the only way to access it is by getting into a state of non - thinking.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 86 · Location 896
   You have to do what you haven’t done in order to get what you don’t have.
   Highlight (yellow) - Page 86 · Location 897
   The fear is only present as long as your thinking is revolving around fear. Once you acknowledge the fear and understand that it’s only your thinking that’s causing those feelings, the illusion will fall apart, and you’ll fall back into peace, joy, and pure love.

   Thinking and thoughts are two different things. Thinking is a verb and requires our manual effort, which causes suffering. Thoughts are nouns, which do not come from us and are divine downloads from the Universe.

   You may be having thoughts, but you are unattached to them and are allowing them to just flow through you without any friction or pain that comes from thinking. You don’t feel any psychological or emotional suffering. You’re not thinking about the past or future. They simply do not matter or exist to you because you’re fully in the present moment.
